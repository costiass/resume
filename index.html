                <h2>RVZ internship</h2>
                <h3>1 week - January 2023</h3>
                <p>During my one-week internship at RVZ, an audiovisual equipment rental company, I had the chance to quickly immerse myself in the operations of the business. My primary responsibilities included assisting with the preparation and maintenance of rental equipment, as well as helping to organize inventory. I shadowed experienced team members, which allowed me to learn about various audiovisual technologies and their applications. This brief but intensive experience sparked my interest in the field and provided me with a solid foundation for my future endeavors in audiovisual production.</p>
